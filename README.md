## Celestial Bodies Database Project

### Overview:

This project is designed to build a PostgreSQL database of celestial bodies, such as planets, moons, stars, and asteroids. The goal is to manage and query data related to these celestial entities using PostgreSQL, and to gain experience working with SQL queries, database management, and PostgreSQL in a Linux environment.

The project is part of a certification course that runs on a virtual Linux machine using Gitpod. Upon completion, the database will be able to store various attributes of celestial bodies, such as name, type, size, distance, and more, enabling users to easily query and explore the relationships between these bodies.
